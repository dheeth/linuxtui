1. If ssh not installed, how do we install it from our TUI? because Linux distro maybe different or we just leave it to user and print to install it?
2. if ip given for ssh is not in network, then it gets stuck into infinite loop. How do I solve that?
3. What if ssh-key gets changed? I mean how do we detect that?
